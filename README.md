gDoorReviews.py is a scraping project. It scrapes any reviews pages. 

Currently, you do have to put in the last part of the URL manually (that represents review page being scraped).

When opening the CSV.. better to not delineate with ';' because some answers have that

todo:
    - Add automatic page traversal
    - Add the "Recommends", "Company Outlook", "Approves of CEO" section
